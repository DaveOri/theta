# theta
T-matrix on HETerogeneous Architectures (provisional name, not sure I will be able to run it on multiple architectures)

Still does not do anything useful.
Development is proceeding extremely slow due to lack of time

  * there is still no documentation and no instructions on how to use it
  * Written in C++
  * Requires libboost.program_arguments
  * requires g++ and linux (quite sure that if you play with the Makefile you can run it on different platforms and use different compilers)
  * Download the code, enter src/ folder and run make
